# E-Commerce-Website
This is a Responsive Fake E-commerce Website
I have built this website using Node.js, Express, Pug, and MongoDB.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your system.

Also, I have removed the node modules as it was taking time to upload so after cloning this project , you will need to install all those using command :

1. npm i
2. npm i express
3. npm i pug
